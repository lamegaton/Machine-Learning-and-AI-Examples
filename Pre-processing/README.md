## Pre-processing data
1. Splitting data into 3 sets: training, validation and testing

	Q: Why do we need to split data into test set, training set and validation set?  
	A: We use test set after training set to find the accuracy or loss of our model. Also, if we have different models, we can test them with validation set. Then the winners among those model will be run with test set as final[12].
