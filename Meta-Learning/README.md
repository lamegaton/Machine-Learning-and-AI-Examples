# Learn how to learn

By far if you have got a bachelor degree, or some kinds of certificate. You probably has built up a system for you to learn new thing.

Below are some references you can read while boring with the current task:

	- the author shows us how to keep a "a beginnerâ€™s mind" in learning new things  
		- why it is important?: because you want to be good, you want to understand and grasp the concepts well, so later on, you can just review and apply that concept. During my undergraduate, I spent a lot of time on learning different Engineering subjects; however, they don't stick well. The problem is that I don't understand them clearly. And just let them pass. Most of the problem can be solved by rode memorization. If you watch "the guardian of galaxy 3" (that's a good movie), you will see that the scientist wants to replicate a creature that can think. Not one that can memorize the problem.
		- I feel a bit overwhelming for undergraduate students, because they have to take many courses, and have no time to ponder their strenghts and interests.
		- Additionally, I used to open more than 10 tabs on my web browsers. If I was back then, I would have open 10 more because of the helps of AI generated contents. Knowing that fact, I limit my self to lecture notes and books that are recommended by professors.
