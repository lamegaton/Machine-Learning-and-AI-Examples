### Linear Regression Models

**Regression**: Mapping inputs to outputs for prediction.  

**Classification**: Mapping inputs to categorical outputs for description.  

Likelihood refers to the probability of the target given the weight. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) is used in multivariate regression.

**Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm[1]. One common question is: what are the differences between perceptron and logistic regression? [2]
