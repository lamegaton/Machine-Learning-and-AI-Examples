While waiting at the bus stop, I was thinking about the non-linear response of voltage and current of the lithium cell. I felt like it was a random walk with constraint depended on the maximum input current.

After going back home, I search for "Random Walk" and found a good paper discussing about gambling. You can check it out here [SOR3012 overview](https://gtribello.github.io/mathNET/SOR3012.html)
