## Status: building  


1. Linear Regression Models
Regression: map input to output: predictive
classification: map inputs to a categorical output: descriptive

likelihood: is the probability of the target over weight 
maximum likelihood estimate (MLE)
multivariable regression

logistic regression: logreg is a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm [1]
because of the similarity one question is that, what are the difference between perceptron and logistic regression [2]


2. McCulloch and Pitts
