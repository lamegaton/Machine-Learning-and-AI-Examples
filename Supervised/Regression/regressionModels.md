## Cost Function

# Q & A
1. why do we take square error in cost function?  
	- beside mean square error we also have mean absolute error. Mean square error is easier to take derivative and it amplifies errors.
2. why do we have 1/2 in cost function?
	- as many physic models, we often add a term to make our calculation easier later. That is the reason we have 1/2 in the cost function.
